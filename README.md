#Introduction

Welcome to this project called “Airbnb EDA” where I will endeavour to articulate my finding about the company with the help of some visualisations and insights which will be directed towards improvements and furtherance of the company overall. I wont make this article very verbose and will keep it as terse as possible. Happy reading!

#Purpose of this project
The purpose is simple, which is to help Airbnb notice some aspects about their business that we unnoticed thitherto. For a company as big as Airbnb it is difficult for the company managers to always read between the lines and pan out with something revolutionary. So the below mentioned visualizations you help them achieve just that. On top of that some recommendations have also been mentioned that may prove to be game changers.

It would be reckless on my part to assume that you are already aware about the company and some of you would not be, in which case I’ll give a brief about the company and its modus operandi.

#Seeking optimal locations:

#What would be a sweet spot:

It seems that Metro and City Centre distance, both are an indicative of attractiveness of a place. The is case the best location in case Airbnb want to expand its operations would be an area which is at a distance of 2 Km or less from the metro station and 5 km or less from the city centre.

#Answering the why?

A simple reason for an increased level of attractiveness in these regions can be the convenience that accompanies such areas. I am are is closer to the metro station is indicated ease of travelling, similarly a city centre nearby hints at increased amenities such as shopping malls and supermarkets.

#What separates the hosts from the super hosts?

1.It seems that there is a paucity of Airbnb super hosts as out of all the hosts, they only constitute for 28 percent of the overall proportion. This roughly means that one out of every 4 host is a super host.

2.Also if we look at the city wise super hosts, the distribution is highly sporadic as more than 50 % of the super hosts are concentrated in three cities namely Rome, Athens and Budapest out of nine!!!

3.Given the importance of super host, it should now be clearly understood that areas which lack the adequate number of super hosts should be give some recommendations which are given below.

#Person capacity:

Super hosts generally provide a greater person capacity than normal hosts. I would recommend the hosts specially in areas like Barcelona, Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris to start increasing the person capacity as this would help them cater to single travelling customers as well as customers who travel in herd or with their families.

#Quality of restaurants:

Restaurant quality is another indicative that separates the hosts from the super hosts. Food is of paramount importance for customers no matter where they stay, good food can offset other limitations and can beget customer satisfaction in a way nothing else can. So I would recommend the hosts in these areas to focus on their quality of the restaurants as this can make all the difference in the world.

#Conclusion

Airbnb continues to be a growing platform and a nemesis for many hotel chains. With such an innovative and design thinking they were able to capture the market swiftly and make a mark of their own. Their business although good is still not perfect and this article was aimed to fill that gap. By filling such a gap they can make sure that they will survive for long and dominate the competition they currently face. We focused how Airbnb can make better decision with the help of some visualisations and the untapped market that Airbnb is still yet to capture. With that being said, I hope this article could be of some use to the readers and Airbnb.
